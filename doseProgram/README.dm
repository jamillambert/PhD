This Program calculates the dose deliverd by a proton beam using
formula from M. Lee et. al 1993. and proton energy data from
J. Janni 1982.
It calculates the dose delivered by a passively scatterd proton beam
or a dynamically scanned proton beam, on a cubic water phantom.
The target can be moved during treatment (intrafractional movement)
or between planning and treatment (interfractional movement).

Code written by Jamil Lambert 2004, improved functionality for PostDoc work 2008.
